**Pang Game ðŸŽ®**

This is a simple and fun Pong-like game created using Python's Turtle module. 
The game consists of two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard. 
Players can control their paddles using the keyboard to bounce the ball back and forth, trying to score points.

**Game Overview**
- Two Players: The game is designed for two players, one using the Up and Down arrow keys to control the right paddle, and the other using W and S keys to control the left paddle.
- Ball Movement: The ball continuously moves around the screen, bouncing off the walls and paddles. When it hits the top or bottom, it bounces back.
- Scoring: When the ball crosses a paddle, the opponent scores a point. The scoreboard displays the current score for both players.

**Features**
- Responsive Paddle Movement: Each player can move their paddle up and down.
- Ball Bouncing: The ball bounces off the walls and paddles, making the game dynamic and challenging.
- Reset Position: If the ball goes past a paddle, it resets to the center and the opponent scores a point.
- Scoreboard: The game tracks the score for both players and displays it at the top of the screen.
